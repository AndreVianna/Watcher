## Strategic Approach for Initial Development of WATCH System

#### Focusing on Item 4 with Support from Item 1

**Executive Overview:**
In alignment with our strategic objectives for the WATCH (Workstation Automated Tracking Control Hub) project, this report outlines the proposed initial development approach. We aim to prioritize the development of Item 4 - Screen Monitoring and Recording - supported by a minimal implementation of Item 1 - Workstation Registration. This approach is intended to provide early value while laying a solid foundation for the full system.

**Rationale for Focusing on Item 4:**
- **High Impact Feature**: Screen Monitoring and Recording is a key component that delivers significant immediate value, showcasing the system's capabilities in real-time monitoring and remote control.
- **Market Differentiation**: Early development of this feature can provide a competitive edge and demonstrate the innovative potential of WATCH.
- **Feasibility and Visibility**: Item 4 offers tangible results that can be easily demonstrated to stakeholders, providing early evidence of progress and potential.

**Minimal Implementation of Item 1 - Workstation Registration:**
- **Necessity for Item 4**: A basic version of the Workstation Registration module is essential for establishing communication channels and security protocols.
- **Scope**: The minimal implementation will include basic workstation identification, secure token exchange, and establishment of a stable WebSocket connection.
- **Future Integration**: This foundational work will seamlessly integrate with the subsequent development phases of WATCH.

**Development Strategy:**
- **Phase 1 - Initial Implementation**:
  - Develop a simplified Workstation Registration module (Item 1) for establishing necessary communications.
  - Simultaneously, start the development of the Screen Monitoring and Recording module (Item 4), focusing on core functionalities like screen capture and remote control via VNC.
- **Phase 2 - Enhancement and Integration**:
  - Enhance the Workstation Registration module with full features and security measures.
  - Integrate enhanced Item 1 with Item 4, ensuring robust and secure operation.
- **Phase 3 - Expansion to Other Modules**:
  - Post successful implementation and integration of Items 1 and 4, proceed with the development of the remaining modules in the WATCH system.

**Expected Outcomes and Benefits:**
- **Quick Delivery of Key Features**: Early focus on Item 4 will enable us to deliver a critical component of the WATCH system ahead of schedule.
- **Foundation for Future Development**: Establishing a minimal version of Item 1 lays the groundwork for the subsequent development and integration of other modules.
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Early demonstration of a key feature will bolster confidence among stakeholders and provide a tangible proof of concept.

**Conclusion:**
This focused initial development approach is designed to maximize early impact and set a solid foundation for the complete WATCH system. By delivering a high-value component early, we aim to demonstrate the potential of WATCH and pave the way for its full-scale implementation.
